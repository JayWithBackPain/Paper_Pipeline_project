## Executive Overview Dashboard

### Daily Key Performance Indicators Trends Panel
- **Processing Volume**: Daily count of papers processed
- **End-to-End Latency**: Average time from data collection to vectorization completion
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successfully processed papers
- **Error Rate**: All end error percentage based on paper counts
- **API Response Time**: Average response time across all services

### Real-time Statistics Panel
- **Papers Collected Today**: Count of papers retrieved from arXiv
- **Papers Vectorized**: Count of papers converted to embeddings
- **Active Traces**: Number of currently processing TraceIDs
- **Queue Depth**: Pending items in processing pipeline
- **Storage Size**: Daily data growth in S3 and DynamoDB

### Critical Alerts Summary Panel
- **Active Alerts**: Current system alerts requiring attention
- **Recent Incidents**: Last 24 hours error/warn log
- **Performance Warnings**: Threshold notifications
- **Capacity Alerts**: Resource utilization warnings

## Data Collection Service Monitor

### Processing Performance - daily trend
- **arXiv API Response Time**: Average response time
- **Retry Attempts**: requests requiring retry counts
- **Request Error Rate**: Percentage of failed API calls
- **Memory Utilization**: Lambda memory usage percentage

### Data Quality Indicators - daily trend
- **Papers Successfully Collected**: Count of successfully retrieved papers
- **Parsing Failures**: Number of XML/JSON parsing errors
- **Data Validation Errors**: Invalid or incomplete paper records
- **S3 Upload Success Rate**: Percentage of successful file uploads

## Batch Processing Service Monitor

### Processing Performance - daily trend
- **Average Processing Time**: Time to process each batch
- **Memory Utilization**: Lambda memory usage percentage
- **Failed Rate**: Percentage of failed batch processing attempts

### Data Deduplication Analysis - daily trend
- **Papers Before Deduplication**: Original paper count in batch
- **Papers After Deduplication**: Unique papers after duplicate removal
- **Deduplication Rate**: Percentage of duplicates found
- **Invalid Records Count**: Papers with missing or invalid data

### DynamoDB Operations - daily trend
- **Write Success Rate**: Percentage of successful database writes
- **Write Failures**: Count of failed upsert operations

### TraceID logs
- **Completed Traces**: Successful process
- **Failed Traces**: Failed process
- **Trace Duration**: Average time from creation to completion

## Vectorization Service Monitor

### Processing Performance - daily trend - both go / python service
- **Average Processing Time**: Time to process each batch
- **Failure Retry Count**: Number of retry attempts for failed operations
- **Memory Utilization**: Lambda memory usage percentage

### DynamoDB Operations - daily trend
- **Write Success Rate**: Percentage of successful database writes
- **Write Failures**: Count of failed upsert operations

## Alerting Strategy

### Critical Alerts (Response to SNS)
- Step function - flow stop
- Step function - flow duration over 30 mins
- DynamoDB throttling events exceed 10
- Success rate in each process drops below 80%

### Warning Alerts
- Memory utilization exceeds 80%
- Deduplication rate outside normal range
- Success rate in each process drops below 95%
